For Underweight Persons (Goal: Muscle Gain)

To gain weight healthily, focus on resistance training to build lean muscle mass rather than fat. 
Compound Exercises: These work multiple muscle groups and are most effective for bulking.
Squats: Targets glutes and quadriceps.
Push-ups: Builds chest, shoulders, and triceps.
Pull-ups: Strengthens arms, shoulders, and back.
Bench Press: Essential for increasing upper body mass.
Cardio Approach: Limit cardiovascular exercise to brief sessions (e.g., 20 minutes, 3 times a week) to protect heart health without burning excessive calories needed for weight gain.
Frequency: Aim for 2–3 strength sessions per week, allowing 48 hours of rest between sessions for muscle repair.
