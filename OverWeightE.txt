For Overweight Persons (Goal: Fat Loss & Safety)

Prioritize low-impact activities to burn calories while minimizing stress on joints. 
Low-Impact Cardio:
Walking: A primary, accessible exercise for beginners.
Swimming/Water Aerobics: The water’s buoyancy supports body weight and reduces joint strain.
Stationary Cycling: Recumbent bikes are especially helpful for those with back or balance issues.
Strength Training: Adding muscle boosts your metabolic rate, helping you burn more fat even at rest. Start with Wall Push-ups or seated leg lifts before moving to weights.
Duration: Gradually work up to 150–300 minutes of moderate activity per week.
